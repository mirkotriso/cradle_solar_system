# cradle_solar_system
The repository containes a packaged version of an interactive tool developed with threejs to simulate the dynamics of asteroids in the Solar System.

This is part of the dissemination activities of the EU-funded MSCA CRADLE Project, which is a collaboration between Politecnico di Milano and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to study the dynamics of ejecta particles around small bodies and the possibility to perform their collection in orbit.

The repository has been used to create a GitHub page, which is has then been embedded into the CRADLE Project website (www.cradle.polimi.it).
